# ImLLM

**ImLLM** is a Golang-based program that provides a chat-style web front-end and an LLM (Large Language Model) API gateway. The program enables users to assume the role of an LLM, crafting responses to incoming API requests.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**  
  Provides a chat-like environment where users act as the LLM, manually responding to API requests.

- **LLM API Gateway**  
  Supports various mainstream LLM API formats, ensuring seamless integration with different LLM services.

  **API Support:**
  - [x] OpenAI API

## Usage

### 1. Run & Configure

### 2. Login

### 3. Use API

`ApiKey = username + ";" + password`

- `GET /openai/v1/models` Get the list of models.
- `POST /openai/v1/chat/completions` Create a chat completion.

## Value

This program is useful when another application requires an LLM API but the responses from an actual API are unsatisfactory. It allows you to manually provide responses for testing or practical usage.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to pay for an LLM API service, this program can serve as a temporary solution.  
- Another option is to use [lanqian528/chat2api](https://github.com/lanqian528/chat2api) or [Niansuh/chat2api](https://github.com/Niansuh/chat2api); however, these implementations violate OpenAIâ€™s terms of service, so you should be prepared to face potential consequences.</sub>
